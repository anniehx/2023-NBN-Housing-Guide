      <h1>Foster-Walker Complex (Plex)</h1>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
      <p>
        Plex is a ton of singles arrayed in kind of a maze-like style. Plex used to be limited to second-year students and up, but now it's open to freshmen. Possibly because of that, Plex's formerly isolated reputation has shifted. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One of its perks is a dining hall on the ground floor divided into Plex West (which stays open until 10 pm) and Plex East (known for its stir fry). It's close to the Blomquist gym. The main South Campus mailroom is conveniently located in the basement of Plex.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note: </b>Plex offers all-gender housing, though it is not located in a specific area of the dorm due to the dorm being entirely singles. According to residential services, normally, four students share a single-person occupancy bathroom, which is more private than community-style bathrooms.

      <p class="resident-comment">
        "The vibe depends on which floor you're on. Some floors are very outgoing, and they get to know each other a lot, and they'll be loud at night, but in a good way. Some floors are very keep to yourself, quiet, everybody does their own thing. There's something about the roommate experience that you miss out on, for sure, but I think there are a lot of other aspects that make up for it, especially the fact that the whole building is singles. You get to know people, nobody's like hiding in their room, away from everyone else. You have the food and the convenience store and the laundry, which is very convenient. My least favorite part about living here would be that the walls are very thin. It's in the perfect spot on campus, because it's South Campus, which is by most of the classes, but it's the northernmost part of South Campus, so it's still not far from any of the north buildings. If you have a hard time making friends, though, I might not recommend it."

        "It's pretty lowkey, pretty chill. Not too much goes on in Plex. I think if you're a relatively social person in the first place, living in Plex isn't that bad of a decision for making friends, because you meet people in all sorts of places, and it's nice to be able to come back to your own room and not have a roommate. The walls are super thin, which isn't great, and the bathrooms aren't super nice, but they do the job."

        "It's very chill, it's very friendly. I would say most of the friends I have come from Plex. It's the Plex ecosystem. I think there's a stigma because of Plex being kind of an isolation dorm because of COVID and because it's all singles, but I actually found it very easy to make friends because no one had that instant roommate connection, so everyone was always out in the hallways."

        "Honestly, I was a bit hesitant when I first moved in because it's just a dorm full of singles, and everyone called it the prison dorm or the quarantine dorms, but after moving in I realized that my floor has a cute little community. My least favorite thing is how thin the walls are, because I'm kind of loud, and I feel bad especially because of my loud friends. I love that the dining hall and package center are right downstairs. It's kind of in the middle of campus, so it's not too far from either end, and it's closer to downtown when I have to do things there. My favorite thing is having a single dorm that's pretty cute. We have brick walls and windows that don't have bars on them, which is pretty cool."
